MAME 4-way stick games for iPhone iPad iOS

May 17, 2012

This is a version of MAME 0.112 for games that use a 4-way stick for the controls, such as Pac Man and Frogger. The screen fills up the entire display in portrait mode.  I thought I would just release the source in case anybody finds it interesting.  Theoretically, if you have a developer certificate, you should be able to load the project into Xcode, change the Bundle ID, change the Code Signing, build the app, then finally drop the rom file (with extension ".zip") that you legally own into the Documents directory using iTunes, and it should work.  Touch the money bag to insert a coin and the person to start the game.

I've tested it on an iPad 2 and iPhone 4S both running iOS 5.1.
